        E-commerce businesses typically fall into one of four main groups. The
        model is typically determined by who is selling and who it's being sold
        to. Business to consumer (B2C): In this e-commerce model, the business
        sells directly to a consumer. If you buy a product from a retailer like
        Amazon, you're purchasing from a B2C company. Setting up a Shopify store
        to sell your wares to customers is considered B2C. Business to business
        (B2B): The B2B model involves selling products or services to other
        businesses. For example, a wholesale company that sells car parts to
        factories is B2B. Consumer to business (C2B): With C2B, individuals sell
        their products or services to a business through an online platform.
        Social media influencers and bloggers fall under this category if they
        receive money from businesses to promote the brand. Consumer to consumer
        (C2C): C2C e-commerce models typically involve online websites where
        people to sell goods and services directly to others. Examples include
        eBay, Facebook Marketplace, and Etsy.
