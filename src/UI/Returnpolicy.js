      <h3>Cancellation Policy </h3>
      <br></br>
      The customer can choose to cancel an order any time before it's
      dispatched. The order cannot be canceled once itâ€™s out for delivery.
      However, the customer may choose to reject it at the doorstep. The time
      window for cancellation varies based on different categories and the order
      cannot be canceled once the specified time has passed. In some cases, the
      customer may not be allowed to cancel the order for free, post the
      specified time and a cancellation fee will be charged. The details about
      the time window mentioned on the product page or order confirmation page
      will be considered final. In case of any cancellation from the seller due
      to unforeseen circumstances, a full refund will be initiated for prepaid
      orders. Flipkart reserves the right to accept the cancellation of any
      order. Flipkart also reserves the right to waive off or modify the time
      window or cancellation fee from time to time.<br></br> <h3>Returns Policy</h3><br></br> Returns is a
      scheme provided by respective sellers directly under this policy in terms
